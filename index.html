      <p class="hidden">JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. Like HTML and CSS, you do not need to install anything to begin writing JavaScript or see it run on your users' computers. All modern browsers support JavaScript which means JavaScript that you write for your web pages will automatically run when your visitors load your web page in their browsers. In fact, JavaScript is the only scripting language that all browsers support so if you want a page to have dynamic content, learning JavaScript is a must.</p>

    <div class="flashcard">
      <p>Operators</p>
      <p class="hidden">An operator is a special character (or characters) that indicates an action to be performed.</p>

    <div class="flashcard">
      <p>Variables</p>
      <p class="hidden">Variables can be thought of as containers used to store information. They allow for a way to label data with a descriptive name.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashcard">
      <p>Variable naming conventions</p>
      <p class="hidden">Use lowerCamelCase when naming JavaScript variables. Start with a lowercase letter, and if the variable name is more than one word, remove all spaces and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="flashcard">
      <p>jQuery</p>
      <p class="hidden">is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to incorporate JavaScript on your web pages. When we say it is a library, we mean that many common tasks that would take many, many lines of JavaScript code to execute have been packaged into methods that you'll be able to use with a single line of code. These methods are always available and ready to use the same way you might check out a book at a library. The goal of jQuery is to allow its users to "write less, do more". It's also one of the primary ways we can add interactivity to our sites.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashcard">
      <p>Attributes</p>
      <p class="hidden">these are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashcard">
      <p>Documentation and Resources</p>
      <p class="hidden">MDN is one of the best sources of documentation on JavaScript. The site includes guides, tutorials, reference, tools and resources for developers using JavaScript.</p>
      <p class="hidden">The official jQuery site has great documentation on all of the methods and tools that are available when you use the jQuery library.</p>
      <p class="hidden">Stack Overflow is a good resource for finding answers to specific challenges that you are facing. It's a site for asking and answering questions about programming. You do need to be careful about what you find there, as there is plenty of bad information to go along with the good. Make sure to search to see if somebody has already answered your question before posting. And double-check that any posts you're referencing are fairly recent (technology changes quickly!) Also, give back by answering questions for other people!</p>
      <p class="hidden">Finally, if you're stuck on something, chances are, somebody has gotten stuck on it, too - try a search engine. To make sure you get up-to-date results, may find it helpful to limit your results to the past year (in Google, click Search tools in the bar above your search results, and then change All time to Past year). It's helpful when searching to add the language to your search so you don't find yourself weeding through results for other languages (e.g. "adding an element to an array JavaScript" or "jQuery clicking a button").</p>

      <p class="hidden">The code responsible for the interaction between the user and the application; handles tasks such as event listening, user input forms, DOM manipulation, display and styling. We have not covered how to write the actual code for this yet; don't worry!</p>

      <p class="hidden">an event handler "listens" to the element(s) to which it's attached and responds when a certain event is triggered. .click() is a click listener, which is a type of event handler that responds when an element to which it's attached is clicked.</p>
